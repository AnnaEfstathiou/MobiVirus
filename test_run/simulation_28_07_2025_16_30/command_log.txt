Command: MobiVirus_Simulator.py -events 500 -msprime -r
-r: Provide the ability to recombinate genomes, if 2 infections happen during a certain time period.
-events: The simulation stops when the given number of events (movements+infections) happpens.
-msprime: Begin the simulation with genomes created by msprime. Introduce the super strain mutation at the "ss_form" event.

Upper bound for the spacial axis (bound_h): 6.0
Mutation rate for each genome position (r_m): 1e-06
Number of important genome positions (n_i): 3
Area of the important positions in the viral genome that define the super strain (region_pos): middle
Infection rate (ri): 1.0 (ns), 2.0 (ss)
Movement rate (rm): 0.08 (infected), 0.1 (healthy)
Infection distance (inf_dist): 0.5 (ns), 0.5 (ss)
Probability of infection (prob_inf): 0.8 (ns), 0.8 (ss)

Recovery time (rec_t): 1.0 (ns), 1.0 (ss)
Immunity time (imm_t): 0.05 (ns), 0.05 (ss)
Relative infected mobility (rim): 0.5 (ns), 0.5 (ss)
Generations to get a sample (sample_times): 100
Event that the super strain mutation is introduced for the 1st time: 0
Period of events when the super strain is introduced (if previously there are no individuals with a super strain): 200
msprime parameter: Parameter defining whether to simulate with population demography or not (use_demography): False
msprime parameter: Present-day population size (initial_pop): 10000000
msprime parameter: Past population size (past_pop): 100
msprime parameter: Time (in generations) at which population growth stops and becomes constant (t_gen): 50
